My name is Les, I've been working in the food industry for 45+ years and am here to help you boost your [food hygine ratings](https://ratings.food.gov.uk/) and set great practices to deliver the best quality food.

I've previously advised;
- x big company
- y
- z

## Results
Over the past year I've advised 100 restaurants.

On average I've helped business go up x1.89 food hygine scores over the past 3 years.

Here are my most recent results;
